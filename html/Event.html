          <h2>Fictionary</h2>
          <p>A quiz event based on series, novels, films, and characters that find a special corner in our
            hearts. Fictionary gives us a breather from all the debating events in our repertoire.
            Participants have to be quick and witty to make the cut. Last year, Fictionary gathered over 500
            participants. Performances were seen from every year, be it first, second, third, or the final
            year. We got to see a brilliant display of fast thinkers.</p>

          <p>A shocking murder occurs, putting you and your kin at odds. What cards will you play in this
            grave situation? Will you stay silent and let bloody hands be lost in the darkness of greed and
            sinister machinations, or will you commence the hunt to catch the killer? The choice is yours!
            Everyone seems to have a motive, with distrust soaring! Are you sure you can catch the culprit
            while defending yourself from bitter accusations?</p>

          <h2>Interface</h2>
          <p>The Debating Society does not stop at just public speaking events. As a well rounded society,
            last year, we hosted a panel discussion that helps college students with placement interviews,
            with a panel consisting of the established alumni of the college. The first day consisted of a
            panel discussion, wherein the alumni spoke about the skills necessary for an interview. On the
            second day, interested students were able to sit in a one-on-one mock interview, held by the
            members of the panel.</p>

          <p>The Asian Parliamentary Debate is our flagship, fest-scale event conducted on an international

            competition got even better to bring out the best in the pan-India participants, fighting for
            the top spot over three days. This APD saw 180+ participants; ranging from the prestigious Delhi
            Debating Circuits to International Invited Adjudicators. It is the largest of its kind in

          <p>As seniors, we understand how exciting it is to gather information regarding the college.
            This series, Know Your Campus, was tailored for the new joinees with the motive of taking
            them through a virtual tour of the campus. Last year, this series extended over a week, with
            pictures and videos to go along with descriptions of places on campus.</p>

          <p>One of the earliest events of the academic year, Jan Pehchaan is our official club

              batch, and answer their questions. It never boxes itself into just an orientation, with huge

            <p>Ice Breaker was our event to initiate a conversation and to give first years an opportunity
                to think differently on a bit out-of-the-league topics. Participants were asked to send us
                their arguments either in support or in opposition, which were posted if they abided by the
                policies of Facebook. The participants with the maximum likes, comments, and shares plus
                considering OC’s views were chosen to be the winners.We received more than 120 responses
                from the first years.</p>

            <h2>Oxford Union Debate</h2>
            <p>If you, as the debater, have ever wondered just how much you can sway the audience, the
                Oxford Union Debate is just the competition for you. It is a 1v1 debate; each debater
                prepares a stance assigned by the OC. Once the debaters have completed their speeches, the
                audience plays a crucial role and asks questions about the speeches and votes for the side
                which they think has the upper hand. With more than 70 participants, this is just one of our
                hugely packed events.</p>

                <p>We all know how it feels to have to present your ideas, only to find the right words
                    aren’t available. A public speaking workshop, generally conducted at the start of the
                    academic session here helps you overcome all those bouts of stuttering and gives us the
                    confidence boost we all require. The workshop sees massive participation every year, and
                    collects a lot of positive applause as well.</p>

                <p>Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither was our love for debating. It takes time and
                    skill to cultivate the critical thinking skills debating requires, and to help with
                    that, Incipio is a workshop hosted by The Debating Society, NIT Durgapur. We believe in
                    starting early, so the workshop is usually open to students from school as well as
                    college. It was conducted online last year, with massive appreciation from participants.

                <p>One of the most interesting, and adrenaline filled events of the year is Kill Code by The
                    Debating Society. The premise is that there's been a murder, and it looks like there
                    will be more! The participants, as detectives, have to find out the killer and pattern
                    in his string of his killings. However, unless you solve his cryptic puzzles, he is
                    going to take another life. The participants must catch him and not let the killer get

                <h2>Renegado</h2>
                <p>Renegado is a Turncoat debate, in its essence, where you betray your very own stance;
                    that too, in the same breath. A debater is asked to prepare for both sides on a topic
                    and switch their stance in between while speaking. It's an enthralling debate format
                    that is often touted to be a critical assessment of a debater, wherein his/her arguments
                    and rebuttals need to be equally balanced to furnish a great speech.</p>
